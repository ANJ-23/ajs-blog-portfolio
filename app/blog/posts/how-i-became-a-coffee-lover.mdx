![Cup of Coffee On Top of Coffee Beans](/blog_images/coffee_cup.jpg "Cup of Coffee On Top of Coffee Beans")

When I was a child, I asked my mom if I could sip from her coffee mug. She obliged, and so I tried the scorching hot Joe. Since that teeny sip, I held a popular perception of coffee: it tastes bitter and burnt - terrible without tons of cream and sugar.

This would change when I entered college.

## The First Step: Shock Therapy

For the longest time, I had little to no interest in caffeine. What little caffeine I had was in the form of green and black tea bags. I still enjoy their respective earthy and floral flavors!

Then I became a college student. Staying awake for lectures, homework, studies, and exams is a herculean task without caffeine. The inevitable caffeine addiction is like an unspoken prereq for a degree.

Early on, this meant more tea drinking. One or two cups a week became a daily routine. Then I thought, what if I need *way* more caffeine than a cuppa? What if I forgot to study or do my coursework, and my only option is an all-nighter?

"I wanna get used to the taste of coffee," I told myself. I believed that the highly caffeinated tar bomb would be a miracle medicine for emergencies. I went to a cafe beneath one of the libraries. What caught my eye was their darkest roast at the time - a French roast. I saw a flavor profile beneath the coffee listing - something like "bold, with a hint of berries." That was the first time I saw coffee described as something *besides* coffee. Berries? In coffee, of all things?

I ordered a small cup of black French roast. I took one big sip. It was very, very bitter - so bitter that it stuck to my tongue throughout the 40-minute bus ride home. Yet, beneath the harsh bitterness, I did notice a bit of berries. It sort of tasted like razzberry!

In retrospect, it might not have been a traditional French roast. There was something beyond the burnt and roasty flavor profile of most French roasts, after all. Regardless, I kept asking myself throughout that day: "Is there is more to coffee than bitter, liquid ash?" I proceeded to routinely use my mom's Keurig machine to find out. I wanted to both further condition myself to coffee and taste flavors hidden by the bitterness. No milk, cream, or sugar - just straight black bean juice.

And thus, my highly caffeinated coffee journey began.

## "Big Trouble" With Whole Beans: A Peek Into Specialty

To be honest, the K-Cups I had paled in comparison to that "French roast." I slowly got used to the burnt coffee taste, but there wasn't much to say in terms of flavor. Caribou's Daybreak blend had a teeny bit of sweetness, but almost everything else was a lot of bitter ash.

A few months later, during winter break, my oldest sister visited with a gift for Mom and Dad. What she brought was a bag of specialty coffee - specifically, a whole bean bag of [Counter Culture Coffee's Big Trouble blend](https://counterculturecoffee.com/products/big-trouble).

Funnily enough, we ran into trouble with those beans. There weren't any defects or anything, but we had no way to use the beans right away. Our old drip machine stopped working years ago, and we didn't know where the coffee grinder was. After some storage digging, we found both the grinder and a reusable K-Cup - a K-Cup that was never used!

Right away, I ground those beans with a cheap blade grinder and fed the grounds through that reusable pod. The coffee snob in me today would normally wince at this method, but to this day, it produced one of the tastiest cups I ever had. It was so nutty and caramelly - way better than the pre-packaged K-Cups I tried in the past!

I wasn't fully into specialty coffee yet, let alone hear the term. But, I was wide awake for the classic bagged coffee - and quietly snoozed on premade plastic pods.

## The Second Dark Roast Phase: Featuring Peet's

For a while, my coffee preferences leaned towards darker roasts. According to Counter Culture, their Big Trouble blends are medium-dark roasted. I then associated darker roasts with caramel, dark chocolate, and generally sweet flavors.

At the same time, I looked for coffee with flavor profiles on the bag. Specifically, I wanted something similar to either that library cafe's "French roast" (roasty, with subtle notes of fruit) or Big Trouble (caramelly and nutty). This drew me to [Peet's House Blend](https://www.peets.com/products/house-blend) - which lists spice, citrus, and toast flavors.

While it wasn't quite like the two aforementioned coffees, I couldn't get enough of it. It wasn't as bitter as other dark roasts, and while I wouldn't say it tasted citrus-y, it was relatively smooth with a nice creaminess.

For another few months, I stuck with Peet's. I still thought that coffee was *supposed* to be bitter, but I also believed that good coffee is more flavorful.

As a side note, I still think Peet's has solid dark roasts.

## Local Roasters: From Word-of-Mouth To Rabbit Hole

I overheard my coworkers discuss what coffee they've been drinking lately. They mostly brought up their favorite local roasters. My interest was piqued; I thought that America's coffee was roasted in a select few facilities, but it turns out they can be roasted anywhere - including Minnesota!

After going home, I looked up coffee roasters near me. I found one that used to be literal minutes away from my house: [Norte Café](https://nortecafe.shop/). I ordered the [4 Variety Coffee Pack](https://nortecafe.shop/products/4-pack-coffee-light-roast-medium-roast-and-dark-roast-and-decaf-8-ozs-per-pack-arabica-coffee-gourmet) to see how good locally roasted coffee can be.

While the decaf and dark roast were thin and flavorless, the medium and light roasts were **incredible**. The medium roast was super nutty and caramelly - like Counter Culture's Big Trouble blend, but better. The real star of the show, however, was the light roast. The flavor profile was an immaculate mix of sugar, nuts, and lemon citrus; it was so delectably bright and complex. None of that bitter coffee taste, either!

This singlehandedly made Columbian coffee among my favorite coffee origins. But more importantly, I officially descended down the coffee rabbit hole. My taste buds have been introduced to the possibilities of lighter roasts, and I wanted to further maximize what I can get out of coffee.

## Into The Rabbit Hole: Specialty Coffee

**Specialty coffee**, also known as third-wave coffee, essentially refers to premium grades of coffee. According to the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), to be "specialty-grade" is to score at least 80 out of 100 points by Q Graders - a select group of professional coffee tasters.

What makes this coffee significant is not just the flavor, but its supply chain as well. The beans are indeed more expensive, but the price typically comes with the promise of higher wages for coffee farmers, strict regulations to ensure safe working conditions and high-quality coffee, and sustainable practices.

Why am I explaining the buzz around expensive coffee? Because I believe that it is worth trying at least once. Not only are you supporting coffee farmers around the world, you also taste their greatest coffee in return. You get none of that burnt "coffee taste," but a vast spectrum of flavors instead. Wanna taste brown sugar, apple, blueberry, red wine, or even cola? There's a coffee for that.

And don't even get me started on all the different methods of brewing coffee - each with their own distinct flavor profiles on top of the coffee's natural flavor. Aeropress, Chemex, V60, Clever Dripper, automatic drip, moka pot - you name it!

## Final Thoughts

![Coffee beans](/blog_images/coffee_beans.jpg "Coffee Beans")

To summarize, I went from a coffee hater, to a reluctant coffee drinker, to an addict who splurges on coffee beans and brewing devices. I won't force you to drink from an $18 bag of coffee; I'm not *that* kind of snob. But...I do hope for a day where a "standard" cup of coffee doesn't taste as ashy as Starbucks - where even the most stubborn coffee hater can change their mind about the bean.
