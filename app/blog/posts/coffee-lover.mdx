## The First Step: Shock Therapy

drank a french roasted coffee that listed notes of berries, was very bitter but it did taste like berries beneath the bitterness, drank from my mom's keurig machine more often cause i enjoyed the modern "burnt and roasty" flavor profile of most coffees (more on that later)

## "Big Trouble" With Whole Beans: A Peek Into Specialty

[Counter Culture's Big Trouble blend](https://counterculturecoffee.com/products/big-trouble)

To this day, those whole beans produced one of the tastiest cups of joe I've had. Mind you, I ground those beans with a cheap blade grinder and fed the grounds through Keurig's reusable pod. The coffee snob in me would normally wince at that method, but it was so much better than every pre-packaged K-Cup I ever had.

i wasn't fully into specialty coffee yet, nor did i know what specialty coffee was

## The Dark Roast Phase: Featuring Peet's

at the time, i enjoyed dark roasts - specifically roasty, but with subtle notes of sweetness and fruit

## Local Roasters: Word-of-Mouth of a Rabbit Hole

overheard my coworkers discuss their favorite local roasters, i looked up coffee roasters near me, and i ordered the sampler from [Norte Cafe](https://nortecafe.shop/products/4-pack-coffee-light-roast-medium-roast-and-dark-roast-and-decaf-8-ozs-per-pack-arabica-coffee-gourmet). the decaf and dark roast were thin & flavorless, but the medium & light roasts were INCREDIBLE.

also known as "third-wave coffee"
