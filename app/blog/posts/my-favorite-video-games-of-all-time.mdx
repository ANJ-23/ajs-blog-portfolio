I remember playing video games since I was 4 years old. I mostly played on a PC and Nintendo devices, and while I played literal hundreds of games, it didn't take too much time to handpick my all-time favorites.

Below is a quick overview of my top five games.

## 5. Dark Souls

As big of a Dark Souls fanboy as I am, I will admit that the brutal difficulty and clunky controls are not for everyone. Heck, I nearly dropped this game the first time I played it - until I learned about its shockingly diverse combat options and role-playing possibilities. Look beneath its griddy atmosphere and "YOU DIED" moments, and you may find highly rewarding gameplay and fantastic world-building.

Although Dark Souls is the most recent addition to this list, it more than warranted its place in my favorites.

## 4. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

Oh Morrowind, my beloved. Words cannot describe how addicted I was to this game throughout my last year of high school and first two years of college. It consumed me so much, it swapped places with my League of Legends addiction.

Even back then, the gameplay was awkward and unintuitive within the gaming landscape. To me, that hurdle is absolutely worth overcoming. The world-building is among the best in gaming history. The main story is incredible. And the role-playing options are broad and diverse.

Once you figure out the gameplay mechanics, it's easy to see why people prefer Morrowind over Oblivion, Skyrim, and even Daggerfall.

## 3. DOOM (1992)

Say hello to one of the first games I ever played.

While not the first boomer shooter to exist, it was a technical miracle that cemented first person shooters as a genre. Hordes of enemies to plow through, fun as hell (heh) levels, and high octane action. And let's not forget the legendary multiplayer and [modding scene](https://www.moddb.com/games/doom/mods) that persists to this day.

Don't leave yet -- There's a demon around that corner!

## 2. DOOM II

Pretty much everyone agrees that Doom II is better than the first game in every way. New enemies, bigger levels, bigger hordes - all of which bring way more carnage. It even adds a new weapon: the legendary Super Shotgun - capable of blasting even the biggest demons.

Since Doom II has more content, it naturally became the boilerplate for most Doom mods onward. [Armageddon Invasion](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Armageddon_2), anyone?

## 1. Sonic 3 & Knuckles

Yep, I was on Team Sonic as a kid - and this game was the reason.

The classic Sonic speed. The graphical magic with just 16 bits. The levels are surprisingly huge, rewarding both speed and exploration. And while the story was fairly simple, it was effective, charming, seamlessly integrated within the gameplay, and ultimately the cherry on top of this platforming masterpiece.

I hope you enjoyed this quick list!
