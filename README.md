# Portfolio - Cloud Resume Challenge (Microsoft Azure)

## Description

This is a porfolio website that doubles as a blog. The site was cloned from [Vercel's blog starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) and personalized accordingly. Includes:

- MDX and Markdown support
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- RSS Feed
- Dynamic OG images
- Syntax highlighting
- Tailwind v4
- Vercel Speed Insights / Web Analytics
- Geist font

## Usage

In the deployed website (<https://aj-blog-site.vercel.app/>), users can navigate to the Home page, the Blog page, and the GitHub repository for this website with the top navigation bar.

The Home page has a brief self-introduction and a blog feed. The Blog page only has the blog feed. In both pages, clicking on a blog post's title redirects to the respective post. On top of the contents, each post has a "Back to Blog" button that takes the user to the Blog page.

The footer provides the RSS feed, my GitHub page, and my LinkedIn profile.
